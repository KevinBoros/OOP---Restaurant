# OOP---Restaurant
University Project for Object Oriented Programming in C++
The project is in Romanian.

The important part in the first phase is the CPP file only. The program focuses on showcasing classes with "has-a" relationships, coupled with operator overloading, in order to emulate a restaurant. There are two menus, the administrator menu and the customer menu. The customer can choose what they want to order from an assortment of items, and the order will decrease the stoc of ingredients which can be viewed in the administrator menu. The administrator, too, has many options to manipulate the restaurant: increasing and decreasing the stoc, increasing and decreasing prices etc.

Phase two is not finished, but it expands on the first phase by adding reading and writing to files. The important parts here are the CPP file and the binary/text files which record the stoc. Phase 2 currently implements reading and writing from text files and writing (only) to binary files.
